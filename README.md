## 1.06.24 Online Shop

Develop a simple prototype for an online shop
1. Define classes Client, Items, Transaction
2. Write the logic so that each client can purchase one of several items in a single transaction
3. Make a printout of data with nested loops
4. The program should print out:
- all clients
- all transactions of a client
- all items purchased in each transaction of the client

## 15.06.24 Python individual work/ Data reading

Easy Level
In this level, you will read the data from prices.txt (see additional files),  compute the total price of all items, and count the total number of purchased items. 

! If you don't know how to deal with non integer characters, remove them manually from the file !

Medium Level
In this level, we will extend the program to skip rows that contain anything other than a number in the code. (Modify your program in such a way that all rows that contain something else than a number, are skipped.)

## 13.07.2024 Python individual work - learning from Titanic disaster

Objective: In this assignment, you will familiarize yourself with Python Pandas, a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis. You will use the Titanic dataset to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and create a visualization using Matplotlib pyplot.

Instructions:

1. Dataset Acquisition:

Obtain the Titanic dataset. (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) or use datasets available directly through Python libraries.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

* Load the Titanic dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
* Use Pandas methods to explore and understand the dataset:
  * Display the first few rows to get an overview of the data structure.
  * Check the dimensions of the dataset (number of rows and columns).
  * Identify missing values and decide on strategies for handling them.
  * Compute basic statistics (e.g., mean, median, min, max) for numerical columns.
  * Analyze categorical variables (e.g., value counts).

3. Data Visualization:

* Choose one column of the dataset that interests you
* Use Matplotlib pyplot to create a meaningful visualization:
  * Select an appropriate plot type (e.g., bar chart, histogram, pie chart).
  * Label axes, add a title.
  * Ensure the visualization is clear, informative, and visually appealing. smile

4. Submission:

* You can include code snippets, comments explaining your thought process
* Submit your completed assignment 

Resources:

* Pandas Documentation: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/
* Matplotlib Documentation: https://matplotlib.org/stable/contents.html
  
Note: Feel free to explore additional functionalities of Pandas and Matplotlib beyond what is specified in this assignment.
